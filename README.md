# lil-roadmap
public display of your linear tickets!

here's one: https://roadmap.tanaki.ai/

### Setup
`npm install`

add your LINEAR_API_KEY in `.env`
you can find it in settings > my account > api 

tickets with tag `public` will display in the public roadmap. 
well.. they should but you're gonna need to get the ID of the tag you wanna filter for now ðŸ™ƒ

IDK what i'm doing really. I just hacked this together for Tanaki.
